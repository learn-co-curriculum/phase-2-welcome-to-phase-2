# Welcome to Phase 2

## Learning Goals

- Understand how this phase is structured
- Learn the outcomes of this phase

## Intro to Phase 2

Welcome to Phase 2! In Phase 1, you learned the fundamentals of JavaScript as a
language, and how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, respond to user
events, and make network requests. In this phase, you'll be introduced to the
most popular frontend library of the last several years: React.

React itself is written in JavaScript as a tool for JavaScript developers, so
all the fundamentals you learned — working with functions; manipulating
arrays; and dealing with complex objects — are going to be crucial to your
success with React.

What you'll get in return is a library that does a lot of the heavy lifting in
terms of handling the DOM manipulation side of your applications.

React comes with strong opinions about how your code is written, in the form of
a _component-based_ architecture. Your success in this phase will come down to
how well you adapt to React's philosophy and pattern of writing code, and how
well you can apply your JavaScript knowledge.

## Phase 2 Structure

This phase is structured around first learning the React fundamentals, then
adding complexity by learning a bit about the React ecosystem and other tools
that you can use with React to make more advanced websites. Each module of
content (a section of labs and readmes) ends with a quiz or "putting it all
together" lab where you can check your understanding of the material. Here's
what each module covers:

### Introduction to React

Get an overview of what React is all about and its philosophy, as well as the
tools needed to get a React application up and running with functionality
provided by different JavaScript packages.

### Components and Props

Components are the building blocks of every React application. Learn how to
separate out your UI into small, reusable bits of code known as components.
You'll also learn about JSX, which is React's declarative syntax for
representing the DOM; and props, which is how data is shared between different
parts of your application.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build a _static_ website with
React components.

### State and Events

React's state system is where most of the "magic" happens in a React
application. Learn how to use the `useState` hook, and how state can re-render
DOM elements in response to events. By the end of this module, you'll be able to
build a _dynamic_ website that changes in response to user events.

### Side Effects and Data Fetching

A component's "main effect" is to produce some DOM elements; however, it can
also be useful to handle some "side effects" as part of your component's
rendering logic. In this module you'll learn how to use the `useEffect` hook
with components to perform side effects, and interact with an API to fetch data
that your components can use. By the end of this module, you'll have covered all
the core React fundamentals and will be able to make a single-page application
in React.

### [Optional] React Under the Hood

In this optional module, you'll learn a bit more about the tools that help
React do its job, like Babel and webpack. You'll also learn about the process of
"Reconciliation" in React, and how React is able to manage changes to the DOM in
a highly performant manner. This module is less hands-on, but it'll help your
mental model of how React actually works (and will definitely help with React
interview questions down the road).

### Client-Side Routing

For most applications, having different pages and some navigation is essential.
Learn how to create multiple "pages" in a single-page application that each have
their own unique URL, thanks to a popular tool in the React ecosystem, React
Router.

### [Optional] Advanced Hooks

You can get a lot of mileage out of the two hooks we've taught up to this point:
`useState` and `useEffect`. However, there are a few other hooks that cover
different cases that will be discussed in this module. We'll also cover how to
create your own custom hooks and abstract some of the logic for managing state
and effects outside of your components.

### [Optional] Class Components

For many years, the only way to work with state and lifecycle methods in React
was to use **class components** instead of function components. Even though the
React team recommends writing function components nowadays, it's very likely
that you'll come across legacy code, blog posts, and documentation that uses
class components instead. In this module, we'll show how to refactor function
components to class components to help learn the similarities and differences in
syntax.

### Additional Practice

This module is full of optional practice challenges. In general, these practice
challenges are meant to be used after you've completed the **Side Effects and
Data Fetching** section to practice with building features of single-page
applications that interact with an API.

## Phase 2 Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:

- Design a React component hierarchy based on a wireframe
- Use React to create components that interact with an API
- Incorporate client-side routing into a single-page application in React

We've got an exciting time ahead, so let's get started!
